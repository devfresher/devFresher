### Hey there 👋🏽

🚀 **Usman Soliu** here, a ✨ `Backend Engineer` ✨ from Ibadan, Nigeria. I am passionate about helping startups deliver better software and providing reliable backend solutions.

💻 My skills include Javascript, Node.Js, MongoDB, TDD, PHP, and Docker. I love exploring new technologies and am currently fascinated by the possibilities of Typescript.

🌱 When I'm not coding, you can find me reading tech blogs or watching videos to learn new skills. I believe staying curious is the key to success in the fast-paced tech industry.

🌟 I am always looking for exciting new projects to work on, so if you have something in mind, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter] (<https://twitter.com/devfresher>) or [LinkedIn] (<https://www.linkedin.com/in/devfresher/>).

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you!
